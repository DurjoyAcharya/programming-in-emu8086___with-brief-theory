# programming in emu8086 (with brief theory)

Hopefully, we all know the basic architecture of 8086. We will also briefly discuss it along with the sample code. Let's start ☺ <br>
👉This is not case sensitive language. So int and INT seems equivalent to it. <br>
👉To comment in code we have to put ( ; ) <br>

# Let's take a single input💦 <br>

⚠️Do you know?:
👉We have 4 types of data resister- `AX`, `BX`, `CX`, `DX`. In 8086 each of them is `16-bit`. Again we divide 16-bit into two 8 bit. Like `AX = AL+ AH` ( 16 = 8 + 8). 

## Steps to take single input - 
   💣Set the value of `ah(AH)` to 1. For this, we have to write- 
  `mov ah,1`  <br>
  💣Give the command to execute. When we have 1 in `ah` and instruct to execute then it will take input and the default input location is `al`.
   For this we have to write- 
   `int 21h`    ; command to execute <br>
   
   ## code-

   
      .model small
      .stack 100h

      .data
      .code
          main proc

              mov ah,1; Just focus on these two lines, else are just a structure, 
              int 21h ; else are like #include and main() in C you can think off now

          main endp
      end main
